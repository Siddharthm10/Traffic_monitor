# Traffic Monitoring System
This is Traffic Analysing system.You can get the entrie summary for the duration of the video played.
Here, I have used YOLOV3 for performing the demo. The accuracy is pretty high with a little compromise in speed. With GPU it gives good performance i.e. 7-10 fps.

### Step to run the server
Step 1: Install all the dependencies into the sytem.
	`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Step 2: After installing the requirements, run the server:
	`python3 app.py`

Step 3: Some configuration can be done for the defaults, which can be found [here](config/config.json)

The server is up and running visit: http://localhost:5000/ to see the demo.
